## Technologies Used:
- **Java Spring Boot**: Backend framework for building microservices.
- **Kafka**: Real-time messaging and communication between services.
- **WebSocket**: Real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
- **Microservices**: Architecture for modular and scalable service development.

## Project Overview:
